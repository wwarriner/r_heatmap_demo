# Demonstration of R heatmap function
A demonstration of the heatmap function for identifying systematic errors in datasets.
I used this to show the usefulness of data analysis to my girlfriend. She works in manufacturing as a process engineer, and a common thread in discussions is the challenge of spotting systematic errors.

Note that the cluster analysis of the heatmap produced in the notebook clearly shows two segments separated by more than half the cluster height.
